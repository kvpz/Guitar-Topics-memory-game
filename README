App Name: What's That Chord
Description: The game is supposed to help the user learn guitar chords.
In the Master View, when the app starts, there will be a list of chords to
select from. Then in the detail view, there will be 6 blocks where each
block contains an image that shows the finger positions for that chord. If the
user selects the correct corresponding block for the chord that they chose, then
the user will get 100 points added to their total correct for the app instance.
If incorrectly chosen, the user will get 0 points. Scores will accumulate until
the reset button in Detail View is pressed.

DEVELOPMENT LOG

- Issue where the detail view is initially presented and not the master view.
- Programmatically setting up collectionView to avoid lack of storyboard
implementations that are equivalent to UICollectionViewFlowLayout.

UICollectionView relies on its dataSource to tell it how many cells to display
and to configure each individual cell before it is presented to the user.
